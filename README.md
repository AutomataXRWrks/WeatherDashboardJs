In this project is contained the web application to retrieve weather data for cities, for challenge 6. Requested aspects for the challenge where made on the code such as:

* WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed

* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
